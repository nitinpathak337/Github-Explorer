Hello Guys,

This is the GitHub Explorer app , I have built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript.

Features of the app:

    * Can search the profile of a github user
    * Can see the public repositories of a github user
    * Implemented pagination and items per page
    * Implemented filtered functionality by searching names of repositories
    * Handled all the edge cases

To run the application in local, follow below steps:

    * Clone the repo in your IDE and click on go live option, if option is not coming then first install Live Server extension.
    * Alternatively , you can directly open the html file by right clicking on it , and then open with any browser you have.
